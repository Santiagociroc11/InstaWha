  # Fix RLS policies for contact lists

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policies
    - Create new policies that properly handle user_id checks
    - Ensure policies work with the current authentication system

  2. Security
    - Maintain data isolation between users
    - Allow users to manage their own data
